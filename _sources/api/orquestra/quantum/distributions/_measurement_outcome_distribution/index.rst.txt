.. py:class:: MeasurementOutcomeDistribution(input_dict: Dict[Union[str, Tuple[int, Ellipsis]], float], normalize: bool = True)

   A probability distribution defined on discrete non-negative integer
   sequences. Normalization is performed by default, unless otherwise specified.

   :param input_dict: dictionary representing the probability distribution where
                      the keys are non-negative integer sequences represented as tuples
                      and the values are non-negative floats.
   :param normalize: boolean variable specifying whether the input_dict gets
                     normalized or not.

   .. attribute:: distribution_dict

      dictionary representing the probability
      distribution where the keys are non-negative integer sequences
      represented as tuples and the values are non-negative floats.

   .. py:method:: get_number_of_subsystems() -> int

      Compute how many subsystems the measurement outcome is composed of.
      This corresponds to the number of qubits in a digital quantum computer.

      :returns:

                number of subsystems in the measurement outcome
                    (i.e. non-negative integer sequence length).
      :rtype: int


   .. py:method:: subdistribution(active_qubits: List[int]) -> MeasurementOutcomeDistribution

      Returns a subdistribution, which represents measurements outcome including only
      the specified qubits.

      :returns:

                indices of the qubits that should be included in
                    the subdistribution. Order of the indices will be preserved in
                    the order of the result bitstrings.
      :rtype: active_qubits

.. py:function:: is_measurement_outcome_distribution(input_dict: Dict[Union[str, Tuple[int, Ellipsis]], float]) -> bool

   Check if the input dictionary is a non-negative integer sequence distribution, i.e.:
           - keys are same-length tuples of non-negative integers,
           - values are non negative.

   :param input_dict: dictionary representing the probability distribution where
                      the keys are non-negative integer sequences represented as tuples
                      and the values are floats.

   :returns:

             Boolean variable indicating whether the non-negative integer sequence
                 distribution is well defined or not.


.. py:function:: is_normalized(input_dict: Dict[Union[str, Tuple[int, Ellipsis]], float]) -> bool

   Check if a measurement outcome distribution is normalized.

   :param input_dict: dictionary representing the probability distribution
                      where the keys are non-negative integer sequences represented
                      as tuples and the values are floats.

   :returns:

             Boolean value indicating whether the measurement outcome distribution
                 is normalized.


.. py:function:: normalize_measurement_outcome_distribution(measurement_outcome_distribution: Dict[Union[str, Tuple[int, Ellipsis]], float]) -> Dict

   :param measurement_outcome_distribution: dictionary representing the probability
                                            distribution where the keys are non-negative integer sequences represented

             Dictionary representing the normalized probability distribution where the keys
                 are non-negative integer sequences represented as tuples and the values
                 are floats.
