.. py:function:: bravyi_kitaev(operator, n_qubits=None)

   Apply the Bravyi-Kitaev transform.

   Implementation from arXiv:quant-ph/0003137 and
   "A New Data Structure for Cumulative Frequency Tables" by Peter M. Fenwick.

   Note that this implementation is equivalent to the one described in
   arXiv:1208.5986, and is different from the one described in
   arXiv:1701.07072. The one described in arXiv:1701.07072 is implemented
   in OpenFermion as `bravyi_kitaev_tree`.

   :param operator: A FermionOperator to transform.
   :type operator: openfermion.ops.FermionOperator
   :param n_qubits: Can force the number of qubits in the resulting operator above the
                    number that appear in the input operator.
   :type n_qubits: int|None

   :returns: An instance of the QubitOperator class.
   :rtype: transformed_operator

   :raises ValueError: Invalid number of qubits specified.


.. py:function:: inline_product(factors, seed)

   Computes a product, using the __imul__ operator.
   :param seed: The starting total. The unit value.
   :type seed: T
   :param factors: Values to multiply (with *=) into the total.
   :type factors: iterable[T]

   :returns: The result of multiplying all the factors into the unit value.
   :rtype: T


.. py:function:: inline_sum(summands, seed)

   Computes a sum, using the __iadd__ operator.
   :param seed: The starting total. The zero value.
   :type seed: T
   :param summands: Values to add (with +=) into the total.
   :type summands: iterable[T]

   :returns: The result of adding all the factors into the zero value.
   :rtype: T


.. py:function:: check_no_sympy(operator)

   Checks whether a SymbolicOperator contains any
   sympy expressions, which will prevent it being converted
   to a PolynomialTensor

   :param operator: the operator to be tested
   :type operator: SymbolicOperator


.. py:function:: get_fermion_operator(operator)

   Convert to FermionOperator.

   :returns: An instance of the FermionOperator class.
   :rtype: fermion_operator


.. py:function:: jordan_wigner(operator)

   Apply the Jordan-Wigner transform to a FermionOperator,
   or InteractionOperator, to convert to a QubitOperator.

   Operators are mapped as follows:
   a_j^\dagger -> Z_0 .. Z_{j-1} (X_j - iY_j) / 2
   a_j -> Z_0 .. Z_{j-1} (X_j + iY_j) / 2

   :returns: An instance of the QubitOperator class.
   :rtype: transformed_operator

   .. warning::

      The runtime of this method is exponential in the maximum locality
      of the original FermionOperator.

   :raises TypeError: Operator must be a FermionOperator,
       or InteractionOperator.


.. py:function:: jordan_wigner_one_body(p, q, coefficient=1.0)

   Map the term a^\dagger_p a_q + h.c. to QubitOperator.

   Note that the diagonal terms are divided by a factor of 2
   because they are equal to their own Hermitian conjugate.


.. py:function:: jordan_wigner_two_body(p, q, r, s, coefficient=1.0)

   Map the term a^\dagger_p a^\dagger_q a_r a_s + h.c. to QubitOperator.

   Note that the diagonal terms are divided by a factor of two
   because they are equal to their own Hermitian conjugate.


.. py:function:: reverse_jordan_wigner(qubit_operator, n_qubits=None)

   Transforms a QubitOperator into a FermionOperator using the
   Jordan-Wigner transform.

   Operators are mapped as follows:
   Z_j -> I - 2 a^\dagger_j a_j
   X_j -> (a^\dagger_j + a_j) Z_{j-1} Z_{j-2} .. Z_0
   Y_j -> i (a^\dagger_j - a_j) Z_{j-1} Z_{j-2} .. Z_0

   :param qubit_operator: the QubitOperator to be transformed.
   :param n_qubits: the number of qubits term acts on. If not set, defaults
                    to the maximum qubit number acted on by term.

   :returns: An instance of the FermionOperator class.
   :rtype: transformed_term

   :raises TypeError: Input must be a QubitOperator.
   :raises TypeError: Invalid number of qubits specified.
   :raises TypeError: Pauli operators must be X, Y or Z.


.. py:function:: chemist_ordered(fermion_operator)

   Puts a two-body fermion operator in chemist ordering.

   The normal ordering convention for chemists is different.
   Rather than ordering the two-body term as physicists do, as
   $a^\dagger a^\dagger a a$
   the chemist ordering of the two-body term is
   $a^\dagger a a^\dagger a$

   TODO: This routine can be made more efficient.

   :param fermion_operator: a fermion operator guarenteed to
                            have number conserving one- and two-body fermion terms only.
   :type fermion_operator: FermionOperator

   :returns:

             the input operator
                 ordered in the chemistry convention.
   :rtype: chemist_ordered_operator (FermionOperator)

   :raises OperatorSpecificationError: Operator is not two-body number conserving.


.. py:function:: normal_ordered(operator, hbar=1.0)

   Compute and return the normal ordered form of a FermionOperator,
   or InteractionOperator.

   Due to the canonical commutation/anticommutation relations satisfied
   by these operators, there are multiple forms that the same operator
   can take. Here, we define the normal ordered form of each operator,
   providing a distinct representation for distinct operators.

   In our convention, normal ordering implies terms are ordered
   from highest tensor factor (on left) to lowest (on right). In
   addition:

   * FermionOperators: a^\dagger comes before a

   :param operator: an instance of the FermionOperator, or InteractionOperator classes.
   :param hbar: the value of hbar used in the definition of the
                commutator [q_i, p_j] = i hbar delta_ij. By default hbar=1.
   :type hbar: float


.. py:function:: normal_ordered_ladder_term(term, coefficient, parity=-1)

   Return a normal ordered FermionOperator corresponding
   to single term.

   :param term: A sequence of tuples. The first element of each
                tuple is an integer indicating the mode on which a fermion ladder
                operator acts, starting from zero. The second element of each
                tuple is an integer, either 1 or 0, indicating whether creation
                or annihilation acts on that mode.
   :type term: list or tuple
   :param coefficient: The coefficient of the term.
   :type coefficient: complex or float
   :param parity: parity=-1 corresponds to a Fermionic term that should be
                  ordered based on the canonical anti-commutation relations.
                  parity=1 corresponds to a Bosonic term that should be ordered based
                  on the canonical commutation relations.
   :type parity: int

   :returns:

             a FermionOperator instance.
                 The normal ordered form of the input.
                 Note that this might have more terms.
   :rtype: ordered_term

   In our convention, normal ordering implies terms are ordered
   from highest tensor factor (on left) to lowest (on right).
   Also, ladder operators come first.

   .. warning::

      Even assuming that each creation or annihilation operator appears
      at most a constant number of times in the original term, the
      runtime of this method is exponential in the number of qubits.


.. py:function:: reorder(operator, order_function, num_modes=None, reverse=False)

   Changes the ladder operator order of the Hamiltonian based on the
   provided order_function per mode index.

   :param operator: the operator that will be reordered. must
                    be a SymbolicOperator or any type of operator that inherits from
                    SymbolicOperator.
   :type operator: SymbolicOperator
   :param order_function: a function per mode that is used to map the
                          indexing. must have arguments mode index and num_modes.
   :type order_function: func
   :param num_modes: default None. User can provide the number of modes
                     assumed for the system. if None, the number of modes will be
                     calculated based on the Operator.
   :type num_modes: int
   :param reverse: default False. if set to True, the mode mapping is
                   reversed. reverse = True will not revert back to original if
                   num_modes calculated differs from original and reverted.
   :type reverse: bool

   Note: Every order function must take in a mode_idx and num_modes.
