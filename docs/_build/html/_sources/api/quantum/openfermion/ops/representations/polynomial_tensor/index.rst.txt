.. py:exception:: PolynomialTensorError

   Bases: :py:obj:`Exception`

   Common base class for all non-exit exceptions.


.. py:function:: general_basis_change(general_tensor, rotation_matrix, key)

   Change the basis of an general interaction tensor.

   M'^{p_1p_2...p_n} = R^{p_1}_{a_1} R^{p_2}_{a_2} ...
                       R^{p_n}_{a_n} M^{a_1a_2...a_n} R^{p_n}_{a_n}^T ...
                       R^{p_2}_{a_2}^T R_{p_1}_{a_1}^T

   where R is the rotation matrix, M is the general tensor, M' is the
   transformed general tensor, and a_k and p_k are indices. The formula uses
   the Einstein notation (implicit sum over repeated indices).

   In case R is complex, the k-th R in the above formula need to be conjugated
   if key has a 1 in the k-th place (meaning that the corresponding operator
   is a creation operator).

   :param general_tensor: A square numpy array or matrix containing information
                          about a general interaction tensor.
   :param rotation_matrix: A square numpy array or matrix having dimensions of
                           n_qubits by n_qubits. Assumed to be unitary.
   :param key: A tuple indicating the type of general_tensor. Assumed to be
               non-empty. For example, a tensor storing coefficients of
               $a^\dagger_p a_q$ would have a key of (1, 0) whereas a tensor
               storing coefficients of $a^\dagger_p a_q a_r a^\dagger_s$
               would have a key of (1, 0, 0, 1).

   :returns: general_tensor in the rotated basis.

.. py:class:: PolynomialTensor(n_body_tensors)

   Bases: :py:obj:`object`

   Class for storing tensor representations of operators that correspond
   with multilinear polynomials in the fermionic ladder operators.
   For instance, in a quadratic Hamiltonian (degree 2 polynomial) which
   conserves particle number, there are only terms of the form
   a^\dagger_p a_q, and the coefficients can be stored in an
   n_qubits x n_qubits matrix. Higher order terms would be described with
   tensors of higher dimension. Note that each tensor must have an even
   number of dimensions, since parity is conserved.
   Much of the functionality of this class is redudant with FermionOperator
   but enables much more efficient numerical computations in many cases,
   such as basis rotations.

   .. attribute:: n_qubits

      The number of sites on which the tensor acts.

      :type: int

   .. attribute:: n_body_tensors

      A dictionary storing the tensors describing
      n-body interactions. The keys are tuples that indicate the
      type of tensor. For instance, n_body_tensors[(1, 0)] would
      be an (n_qubits x n_qubits) numpy array,
      and it could represent the coefficients of terms of the form
      a^\dagger_i a_j, whereas n_body_tensors[(0, 1)] would be
      an array of the same shape, but instead representing terms
      of the form a_i a^\dagger_j.

      :type: dict

   .. py:method:: constant(self)
      :property:

   .. py:method:: rotate_basis(self, rotation_matrix)

      Rotate the orbital basis of the PolynomialTensor.

      :param rotation_matrix: A square numpy array or matrix having
                              dimensions of n_qubits by n_qubits. Assumed to be real and
                              invertible.


   .. py:method:: projected_n_body_tensors(self, selection, exact=False)

      Keep only selected elements.

      :param selection: If int, keeps terms with at
                        most (exactly, if exact is True) that many unique indices. If
                        iterable, keeps only terms containing (all of, if exact is
                        True) the specified indices.
      :type selection: Union[int, Iterable[int]
      :param exact: Whether or not the selection is strict.
      :type exact: bool
